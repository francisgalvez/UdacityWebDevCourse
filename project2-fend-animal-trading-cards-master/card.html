				The leopard is distinguished by its well-camouflaged fur,
				opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad diet, and strength (which it
				uses to move heavy carcasses into trees), as well as its ability to
				adapt to various habitats ranging from rainforest to steppe, including
				arid and montane areas, and its ability to run at speeds of up to 58
				kilometres per hour (36 mph).

				The leopard is one of the five "big cats" in the genus <i>Panthera</i>.
				It is a member of the family Felidae with a wide range in sub-Saharan
				Africa and parts of Asia. Fossil records suggest that in the Late
				Pleistocene it occurred in Europe and Japan.
